Starship and Windows terminal files for customization

----------
### In here you will find
**Starship Configs**
```
starship_configs/

├── kali_starship.toml --> A Kali zsh inspired prompt

├── starship.toml --> File that will be read by starship

└── ubu_starship.toml --> A prompt inspired by the Ubuntu color palette
```
Once you have starship installed, copy `starship.toml` in your `~/.config directory`. To change between themes just copy the style you want into `starship.toml`. 

For example:
```
cp ubu_starship ~/.config/starship.toml
```
